## Change user js

You can make firefox suited to your needs and for the maximum security, privacy, usability and performance without very much tweaking by changing the user js in your browser profile.

Firefox profiles are located by default in `~/.mozilla/firefox/` in Linux and `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\` in Windows.


- Create a new Firefox profile or use an existing one and move to the profile directory. You can navigate to `about:profiles` and find the location for your current profile's root directory as well as find the option to create a new profile. 
- If you want to try this out, you can go with creating a new profile.
- Copy user.js to your profile's root directory test it out for sometime and make the required changes in your original profile.
- For changing some prefs you can create a new file in profile's Root Directory, `user-overrides.js` and fill it with the prefs you want to override. Now, append the content at the end of `user.js` file.
- Done! Happy browsing.
