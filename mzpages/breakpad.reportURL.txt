{{preference|pref=breakpad.reportURL}}

==Background==
Mozilla applications use a set of libraries called [[Breakpad]] to handle client-side crash reporting. When an application crashes, a binary “dump” file is created and submitted to a central server for analysis. By visiting about:crashes, users may see a listing of the crash reports they’ve submitted. This preference determines which report server is linked to on that page.

==Possible values and their effects==
The breakpad report server linked to in about:crashes. Default value for Firefox is '''<nowiki>http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/</nowiki>'''.
