{{preference|pref=signon.autofillForms}}

==Background==
Firefoxâ€™s [[Password Manager]] can expose usernames and passwords on websites with cross-site forms (that is, HTML forms that submit to other domains). This includes many sites that will display unsanitized user-submitted content, such as MySpace.

As an initial defense against such attacks, this preference was created to prevent the Password Manager from auto-filling form fields with usernames and passwords.

==Possible values and their effects==
===True===
Automatically fill sign-in forms with known usernames and passwords on appropriate sites. (Default)
===False===
Do not automatically fill sign-in forms with known usernames and passwords; instead, act as though there are multiple usernames/password pairs remembered for the form (fill password after username has been manually typed).

==Recommended settings==
If you use the Password Manager in Firefox to store your passwords, setting this preference to false will prevent the mentioned attack from succeeding.
