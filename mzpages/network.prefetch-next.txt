{{preference|pref=network.prefetch-next}}

==Background==
Link prefetching is when a webpage hints to the browser that certain pages are likely to be visited, so the browser downloads them immediately so they can be displayed immediately when the user requests it. This preference controls whether link prefetching is enabled.

==Possible values and their effects==
===true===
Enable link prefetching. (Default)
===false===
Disable link prefetching.

==Caveats==
* This preference has no effect in mail clients.

==UI==
===Mozilla Suite===
?

==Recommended settings==
* For sites that use prefetching, disabling this preference will decrease the amount of bandwidth used, but increase the time required to navigate sites.
