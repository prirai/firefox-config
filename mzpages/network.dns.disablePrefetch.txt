==Background==
DNS prefetching was implemented in Firefox 3.5 to improve page load time.  This feature allows Firefox to perform domain name resolution proactively and in parallel for hyperlinks, images, CSS,  JavaScript, and other webpage content.  [http://bitsup.blogspot.com/2008/11/dns-prefetching-for-firefox.html] [https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Controlling_DNS_prefetching]  Note: To disable DNS prefetching using [[about:config]] you will need to add  '''network.dns.disablePrefetch''' as a new boolean preference and set the value to '''true'''.
