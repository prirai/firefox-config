{{preference|pref=network.IDN_show_punycode}}

==Background==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name IDN support] allows users to enter domain names containing extended characters that aren&rsquo;t supported in &ldquo;standard&rdquo; URLs. This makes it possible for international websites to register domain names using characters native to local languages.

In order to expand the number of characters allowable in domain names to include all Unicode characters, a type of encoding called &ldquo;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode Punycode]&rdquo; was developed. This encoding uses legal characters in domain names&mdash;dashes, letters, and numbers&mdash;to represent Unicode characters. When IDN support is [[network.enableIDN|enabled]], Mozilla recognizes domain names encoded this way and converts them into Unicode strings. Thus, a domain name that looks like <tt>http://xn--tdali-d8a8w.lv/</tt> is converted into a domain name that looks like <tt>http://tūdaliņ.lv</tt>.

Mozilla&rsquo;s initial response to [http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/mfsa2005-29.html phishing attacks using IDNs] (after disabling IDNs entirely)  was to display the punycode form of IDN URLs.

This preference determines whether all IDNs displayed in the browser are displayed as punycode or as Unicode.

==Possible values and their effects==
===True===
Display the &ldquo;raw&rdquo;, punycode version of internationalized domain names.
===False===
Display IDNs as intended. (Default)

==Caveats==
* IDN must be [[network.enableIDN|enabled]] for this preference to have an effect.
* Even if this preference is false, only top-level domain that are [[network.IDN.whitelist.*|whitelisted]] will be displayed in Unicode.
